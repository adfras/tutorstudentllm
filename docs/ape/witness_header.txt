WITNESS PROTOCOL (mandatory)

You MUST produce a WITNESS block BEFORE the final answer.

WITNESS
1) RULE: <one-sentence rule> [FC<ID> L<start>–L<end>] "<≤30‑word verbatim quote>"
2) CHOICE: <why the chosen option is correct> [FC<ID> L<start>–L<end>] "<≤30‑word verbatim quote>"
3) If possible, cite ≥3 distinct Fact‑Cards across the WITNESS block. If fewer exist, cite all available cards.

Hard constraints (must obey literally):
- Each claim MUST end with [FC<ID> L<start>–L<end>] and include a ≤30‑word quote in double quotes.
- If you cannot add a quote, output exactly: INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE – NO CREDIT and stop.
