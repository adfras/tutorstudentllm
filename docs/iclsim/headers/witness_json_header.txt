WITNESS PROTOCOL (JSON, mandatory)

You MUST include a top-level key named "witness" in your JSON output.

Witness schema:
{
  "witness": {
    "rule":   {"card_id": string, "quote": string},
    "choice": {"card_id": string, "quote": string}
  }
}

Hard constraints (must obey literally):
- The witness.rule and witness.choice quotes MUST be verbatim substrings (≤ 30 words) from the cited Fact‑Cards.
- The witness.choice.card_id MUST equal the PRO card id for the chosen option (see option_card_ids mapping) and its quote must come from that card.
- If you cannot add witness with valid quotes, output exactly choice:"IDK" and keep JSON valid; do not include explanations.

Do not emit any text outside the required JSON object.
